serato_stripper
===============

Strip Serato tags out of mp3 files

Setup
=====

- `brew install taglib`
- `bundle install`

Instructions
============
Just run `serato_stripper PATH_TO_FILE`. It'll dump a folder with the file's Serato description name into ~/Documents/serato_out (because that seemed like as good a place as any).
